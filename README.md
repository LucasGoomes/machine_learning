<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Repository

This repository serves as a showcase of my machine learning skills, highlighting various projects where I have applied machine learning algorithms and techniques. The projects are a result of my studies, as well as practical implementations during courses and personal exploration. As a result, some folders or algorithms may not follow a standardized project structure.

The projects cover a wide range of topics within machine learning, including regression, classification, image recognition, and natural language processing. By exploring these projects, you can gain insights into my problem-solving approach, algorithm selection, feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretation of results.
